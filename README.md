# Reminder
Python3 based script that reminds you of a particular time on a particular day.
<br><br>
## Reason
I know that tere are alarm clocks for the same purpose. But I am a forgetful person and I love to code and create stuff...
Thus, this file.<br><br>
I was simply bored out of my mind and wanted to do something. Something not big, but not too small either. So my forgetful brain reminded me that I forget everything... So why not create a reminder that reminds you stuff through an alert box.
